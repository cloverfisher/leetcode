I feel so sad about this question. What a stupid solution the OJ gives us. When I try to write in python, it said time exceed when x = 0.0001 and n = 2147483647 . I think that n is too large for python so I change to write it in C language. However I failed in the same reason. So I wonder if they want us to use big number to write this algorithm. If so, this question will be very difficult. So I try to add some condition. For example, return number =0 1. -1. I found it passed.
